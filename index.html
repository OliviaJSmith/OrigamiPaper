                The Origami Paper is an experiment. An attempt to provide a printed place for local individuals of any age 
                who like to write to share their writing. Yes, printed. Writers will submit their pieces and if accepted 
                it will be printed in a newspaper style issue. Anyone can order a copy. Since this is the first 
                issue of the experiment, price of a single copy will be approximately $5 and payment will not be 
                required until the issue is picked up. Writers will receive a copy for free.

                <p class="font-weight-bold">What kind of writing do we want?</p>
                <p class="pt-1">
                    Essays or poetry. Writing that focuses not just on the writer but considers how the community 
                    will interact with it. This is not the place for political discussion rather we want writing that will unite and
                    not divide. All writing must be family friendly and follow convetional writing formats (MLA/APA).</p>
                <hr/>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Please submit writing by March 10th</p>
                <p class="pt-1">Email 500 - 1000 word essays or short poems to <span class="font-weight-bold">origamipaperspokane@gmail.com</span>.
